<b>2D Alien Space Shooter Game </b>| 2022 | <a href="https://github.com/dwolrdcojp/Alien_Shooter">https://github.com/dwolrdcojp/Alien_Shooter</a><br>
● Built an Entity Component System (ECS) Game Engine from scratch with C++, leveraging the open source graphics library SFML. Players have to navigate a spaceship, while shooting at enemies to achieve the highest possible score.<br>
● The game engine allows users to rapidly implement & modify game ideas by creating unique entity containers with the combination of data components. It reads data from config files, allowing for changes to any game entities without the need to recompile.<br>
● Created clear, concise and user-friendly documentation, and wrote & maintained clean and legible code with commenting for others to read, understand and collaborate easily.<br>
● Created a custom Vec2 Class with operator overloading to effectively manage entities movement physics.
